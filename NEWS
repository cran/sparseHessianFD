NEWS FILE FOR sparseHessianFD PACKAGE

VERSION 0.3.3.4

- Fix typo in inst/doc/replication.R.

VERSION 0.3.3.3

- Replaced deprecated Matrix package functions rBind and cBind with
  their rbind and cbind counterparts.

VERSION 0.3.3.2

-  References Journal of Statistical Software paper.

VERSION 0.3.3.1

-  Modified registration of native routines in src/init.c to be
   compatible with new Rcpp naming convention.

VERSION 0.3.3

-  Updated version as accepted at Journal of Statistical Software

-  Explicit registration of native routines, as required by R 3.4.0.


VERSION 0.3.2

-   Added implementation of the complex step method.

-   Revised vignette.

-   The 'direct' argument to the sparseHessianFD initializer was removed
    (defunct).


VERSION 0.3.0

-   An even more major rewrite of the package. All ACM code was removed,
    and replaced with original R/C++ implementations.

-   The sparseHessianFD class is now implemented as an R reference
    class, and not as an Rcpp module. The sparseHessianFD.new function
    is deprecated. Instead, use sparseHessianFD to initialize an object.
    Initialization once again takes place in a single step.

-   The 'direct' computation method has been removed. All computation
    uses the 'indirect' triangular substitution method. The 'direct'
    argument in the initializer for the sparseHessianFD class is now
    deprecated, and remains solely for compatibility with older versions
    of the package.

-   There is a new vignette with a lot more detail about what the
    package does and how it works.

-   New matrix helper functions Matrix.to.Pointers and
    Coord.to.Pointers. The Coord.to.Pattern.Matrix function is
    deprecated. Use the spMatrix or sparseMatrix functions in the
    _Matrix_ package instead.

-   With the removal of ACM-copyrighted code, this package is now
    licensed under the MPL 2.0.


VERSION 0.2.0 (Jan. 28, 2015)

-   Essentially a complete re-write of the package.

-   New vignette, using a binary choice model as an example. Functions
    for this model are in binary.R. Access sample simluated data with
    data(binary).

-   Documentation written using roxygen2

-   Added unit tests using testthat

-   Core class has been renamed sparseHessianFD. Construction and
    initialization are now two separate steps.

-   New function sparseHessianFD.new is a wrapper around the
    construction and initialization steps.

-   Deprecated functions in Version 0.2.0
    -   new.sparse.hessian.object. Use sparseHessianFD.new instead.
    -   Coord.to.Sym.Pattern.Matrix. Use Coord.to.Pattern.Matrix
        instead, with option symmetric=TRUE.
    -   Sym.CSC.to.Matrix. Use the spMatrix function in the _Matrix_
        package instead.


VERSION 0.1.1 (Nov. 5, 2013)

-   Removed functions for sampling from, and computing the density of, a
    multivariate normal distribution. These functions are now available
    in the _sparseMVN_ package.


VERSION 0.1.0 (Nov. 5, 2012)

-   Initial upload to CRAN.
